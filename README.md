# Showing images in an iOS scroll view with Auto Layout

This is a demo iOS app that shows how to add images to a scroll view with Auto Layout. The scroll view lets you scroll through the images in a paged manner. The scrolling stops at the current image but shows a portion of the next and previous images. The demo app is written in Swift 2.0.
